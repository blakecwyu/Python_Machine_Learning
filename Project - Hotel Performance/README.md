# Project - Hotel Performance   
  
## Project Overview  
This project includes two sub-projects applying statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to support better operational and pricing decisions by revealing patterns in demand, occupancy, and revenue across different day types and market segments. It is divided into three parts:  
- Hotel Performance - Statistical Analysis:  
  - **Hypothesis** - Seasonal ADR differences  
  - **Hypothesis** - Occupancy difference between spring and summer  
  - **Correlation** - Relationship between prices and occupancy in seasons  
- Hotel Performance - ML Regression and Classification:  
  - **Regression** – Predict hotel performance  
  - **Classification** – Predicting cccupancy levels  
  - **Classification** – Grouping day types for pricing tiers  
  
The analysis is based on a synthetic dataset simulating realistic hotel performance over a full year (365 days).  
  
---  
## Dataset  
- The dataset is **synthetic**, generated to simulate realistic hotel performance across 365 days.  
- Fields include:  
  - `date`: Calender date in 2023 (used to derive day and month values)  
  - `dayofweek`: Day name (e.g., Monday–Sunday)  
  - `daytype`: Weekday, Peak, or Holiday  
    - *Peak* includes Fridays to Sundays, the day before a holiday, the last day of a holiday, and one-day holiday.  
    - *Holiday* refers to holidays that span **more than one day**, typically combining with a weekend. One-day holidays are not labeled as "Holiday" in this field.  
  - `special_event`: Indicates whether a special event occurs (negative, none, or positive)  
  - `rn_fit, rn_git, rn_corp`: Room nights sold in **FIT**(Free Independent Traveler), **GIT**(Group Inclusive Tour), **Corporate** market segments   
  - `adr_fit, adr_git, adr_corp`: Average Daily Rate (ADR) in each market segments  
  - `rev_fit, rev_git, rev_corp`: Revenue generated in each market segments  
  - `occ`: Occupancy rate (percentage)  
  - `rn_ttl, adr_ttl, rev_ttl`: Total values across all market segments  
  
*Note:  
ADR = Revenue / Room Nights Sold  
RevPAR = ADR * Occupancy*

## Project Sections  
### Hotel Performance - Statistical Analysis  
1. Hypothesis 1 - Seasonal ADR differences  
   *Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in prices (ADR) between seasons.  
   Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one season's prices (ADR) differs.*  
  
   **Features**:  
   - Seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)  
   - ADR  
  
   **Models**:  
   - One-way ANOVA  
   - Tukey's Range Test  
  
   **Goal**: To prove seasonality in hospitality industry and support pricing strategy.  
  
2. Hypothesis 2 - Occupancy difference between spring and summer  
   *Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in occupancy between Spring and Summer.  
   Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in occupancy between Spring and Summer.*  
  
   **Features**:  
   - Seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)  
   - Occupancy rate  
  
   **Models**:  
   - two-sample t-test  
  
   **Goal**: Based on the result of Hypothesis 1, spring and summer are not found significant difference in prices, which contradicts domain experience. Therefore, a new hypithesis based on occupancy differnece is created to explore whether the high prices in spring lead to low occupancy.  
  
3. Correlation - Relationship between prices and occupancy in seasons  
   A scatter plot was created for ADR vs occupancy within the spring season.  
   Pearson correlation coefficients between ADR and occupancy for each season calculated.  
  
   **Features**:  
   - Seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)  
   - ADR  
   - Occupancy rate  
  
   **Models**:  
   - Pearson correlation coefficients  
  
   **Goal**: To explore the assumption that ADR in spring may be too high and reveal relationship between ADR and occupancy in each season.  
  
### Hotel Performance - ML Regression and Classification  
1. Regression: Predicting Hotel Performance  
   Use multiple regression models to predict **total daily revenue** and calculate ADR and RevPAR  
  
   **Features**:  
   - Room nights sold by market (FIT, GIT, Corp)  
   - Occupancy rate  
   - Day of week (Monday–Sunday)  
   - Day type (Weekday, Peak, Holiday)  
  
   **Models**:  
   - Multiple Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regression  
  
   **Goal**: Estimate expected revenue based on operational and calendar variables providing insights for future pricing strategies.  
  
2. Classification: Predicting Occupancy Levels  
   Classify whether a day will have **high occupancy (≥60%)** or **low occupancy (<60%)**  
  
   **Features**:  
   - Day of the month (1st–31st)  
   - Day of week (Monday–Sunday)  
   - Day type (Weekday, Peak, Holiday)  
   - Special event impact (Negative / None / Positive)  
  
   **Model**:  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
  
   **Goal**: To support future pricing strategies by identifying days that are more likely to have low occupancy so that targeted promotional or pricing actions can be taken.  
  
3. Classification: Grouping Day Types for Pricing Tiers  
   Use clustering to identify whether the **existing day types**, weekday, peak, holiday, are sufficient, or if more **refined day types** should be created to better support pricing strategies.  
  
   **Features**:  
   - Room nights sold by market (FIT, GIT, Corp)  
   - Revenue by market (FIT, GIT, Corp)  
  
   **Model**:  
   - K-Means Clustering  
  
   **Goal**: Identify potential new day types (e.g., peak-season weekday, Saturday, event-driven weekend) based on performance patterns, to support more effective pricing tiers beyond the standard 3-category system.

## Results  
### Hotel Performance - Statistical Analysis  
- Hypothesis 1 - **Seasonal ADR Differences**
  - Null Hypothesis (H0) rejected, there are significant differences in ADR between seasons.
  - Tukey’s test shows significant ADR differences between: Fall-Summer, Fall-Winter, Spring-Winter.
  - ADR difference between Spring and Summer is not statistically significant. This contradicts with domain experience, which summer is peak season and spring typically is slower. This raises a question that prices in spring are set too high and lead to low occupancy.
- Hypothesis 2 - Occupancy difference between spring and summer  
  - Null Hypothesis (H0) rejected, there are significant differences in occupancy between spring and summer.  
  - This suggests that prices in spring may be set too high relative to demand, potentially leading to lower occupancy.  
  - However, a scatter plot shows that ADR and occupancy in spring still has positive relationship.  
- Correlation - Relationship between prices and occupancy in seasons  
  - Winter shows the weakest correlation between ADR and occupancy (r = 0.26), while other seasons range from 0.34 to 0.41.
  - Boxplot shows that winter has much wider distribution both in ADR and occupancy.  
  - Based on domain experience, December usually has stronger demand, on the other hand, January and Febuary are lowest months except Chinese New Year holiday.  
  - Theis mix of extremes and low-demand days introduces high variability and possible demand inelasticity, weakening the linear relationship between price and occupancy.  
  
### Hotel Performance - ML Regression and Classification  
- Correlation heatmap shows that total revenue has a **positive relationship** with FIT room nights, occupancy rate, Saturdays, and Holidays. Although GIT and Corporate room nights help fill low-demand days, they are **negatively correlated** with total revenue, likely due to lower average rates in those segments.  
  **This insight may support future strategies for room distribution across different market segments.**  
- Section 1: **Regression - Predicting Daily Revenue**  
  - Both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** were used to predict revenue and average daily rate for future dates, providing insight to support pricing strategies.
- Section 2: **Classification - Predicting Occupancy Levels**  
  - The initial **Decision Tree** for occupancy classification showed overfitting. After pruning and tuning, the model improved. Based on the final tree, we should pay closer attention to **Tuesdays during the end of each month** and **Mondays during the beginning of each month**.   
  - Currently, the occupancy classification includes **all segments**, but in practice, **GIT and Corporate bookings** are used to fill low-demand days and do not follow a consistent weekly pattern. Since GIT availability is seasonal and irregular, it may introduce noise into the model. A future version could classify based on **FIT-only occupancy or revenue**, providing a clearer signal for organic demand and helping to determine when **GIT/Corp support** is needed.
- Section 3: **Classification - Grouping Day Types for Pricing Tiers**  
  - **K-Means clustering** suggests there may be **4–8 distinct day types**, beyond the current weekday/peak/holiday categorization, supporting the idea of more granular pricing tiers.  
  - Based on **domain experience**, we may consider separating **Saturdays** from other peak days, or defining **special weekday/peak patterns** during **seasonal breaks** (e.g., summer or winter holidays). This refined day type classification could also provide **a new perspective** that may help improve the accuracy of both regression and occupancy classification models.  
- Visualizations include **correlation heatmaps**, **decision tree diagrams**, and **cluster visualizations** (see notebook).  
  
---
## Future Improvements  
- **Expand the dataset** by including data from multiple past years to capture seasonal trends and unusual patterns.  
- **Train and validate models with real-world data** to improve performance and generalizability.  
- **Refine the day type classification** to better reflect pricing behavior and occupancy patterns, potentially improving model accuracy.  
- **Incorporate external factors** such as weather conditions or citywide events, which may have a strong influence on occupancy and revenue.  
- **Leverage historical competitor performance data** (e.g., from benchmarking reports) to better position the hotel's pricing and predict market behavior.  
  *Note: This would require real-world data sources and is not applicable to the current synthetic dataset.*
- **Refine classification targets** by focusing on **FIT-only occupancy or revenue**, reducing noise from inconsistent GIT/Corp availability and better identifying truly low-demand days.  
- **Develop an interactive dashboard** to visualize trends, model outputs, and support decision-making by hotel management.  
- **Apply the models to a full future year** for forward-looking predictions to support pricing strategy and resource planning.

# 機器學習專案 - 使用迴歸模型與分群模型分析飯店營運績效  
## 專案概述  
本專案使用 Jupyter Notebook，透過機器學習分析不同日別與市場區隔下的需求、住房率與營收趨勢，協助改善營運與訂價策略。專案分為三個部分：  
- **迴歸模型** - 使用線性迴歸與隨機森林預測每日營收與平均房價。  
- **分群模型** – 使用決策樹分類每日住房率為高（≥60%）或低（<60%）。  
- **分群模型** – 使用 K-Means 分群找出不同「日類型」的數量，以支援更細緻的定價分層策略。  

本分析使用模擬飯店一整年的營運情形（365天）的合成資料，具備接近實際營運邏輯的結構與變異。

## 結果摘要  
- 從Crrelation Heatmap得出，總營收與 FIT 間夜、住房率、週六與假日有**正相關**；GIT 與 Corp 有**負相關**，可能因其平均房價較低。  
  **這有助於未來分配各市場房間策略。**   
- 第1部分: **迴歸分析 - 預測飯店績效**  
  - 透過**線性回歸**與**隨機森林回歸**預測營收與平均房價，可用於做為未來訂價策略參考。  
- 第2部分: **分群分析 - 預測住房率高低**  
  - 初始**Decision Tree**出現過度擬合，經pruning和tuning調整後改善。結果顯示**月初與月底的星期二**需特別關注。  
  - 模型未呈現高度可解釋性，顯示**日期、星期幾、日別與事件**等變數可能無法有效預測住房率高低。基於**領域經驗與Correlation heatmap**，建議加入**月份**作為特徵，以反映飯店業及旅遊業獨特的**季節性**。  
  - 目前此預測住房率高低的分群分析包含**所有市場類別**，但實際上飯店常利用**團客與商務客**來填補淡日空房，並不一定有固定的每週趨勢，且團客數量更易因季節而不穩定，這些因素可能為模型帶來雜訊。未來可考慮**單純以散客**為目標進行分類，以排除團客與商務客的不穩定性，提升模型效率，並在淡日需要**團客和商務客**協助時，提供更可靠的參考。  
- 第3部分: **分群分析 - 日別劃分以做為訂價層級參考**  
  - **K-Means**顯示，相較於原始的3個日別分類，**6–8個日別**是比較適合的，可用於未來訂價層級的參考。  
  - 基於**領域經驗**，可考慮將**週六**自旺日獨立出來，或是根據**旺季(暑假及寒假)**進行更細緻分類，調整後的分類或許也可以改善專案前兩個部分的準確性。    
- 視覺化包括 **correlation heatmaps**, **decision tree diagrams**, and **cluster visualizations** (請見 notebook).
  
---
## 未來改進方向  
- **擴充資料** 加入更多年份的歷史資料，以更全面反映季節性與異常波動。  
- **使用真實資料進行訓練與驗證** 以提升準確度與泛化能力.  
- **重新定義日別類型** 以更精準反映出飯店價格與績效趨勢，並提升模型準確度。  
- **納入外部因素** 例如氣候或大型活動可能會對住房率和營收有重要的影響。  
- **參考歷史競爭對手資料** 以更進一步探索價格及市場趨勢。    
  *註: 需使用真實世界資料，不適用於本合成資料*  
- **重新定義分群目標** 以**單純散客**為主進行分群，排除團客及商務客不穩定所帶來的雜訊，以更準確判斷低需求日。    
- **建立互動式儀表板** 以供經營管理團隊參考趨勢及預測。  
- **應用於未來整年度資料** 以模型預測結果來做為營運與定價策略的參考。
